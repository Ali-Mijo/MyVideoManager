This application is a Vue.js and Laravel based application which allows users to search for Youtube videos using the Youtube Search API.

The primary intention of this code base is to support the video tutorial series that I have created for my [Youtube channel](http://bit.ly/2EtBHne).

Right now, I have used the Youtube API to display the data and also user Javascript library Isotope to create the grid structure. 

Will be adding more features to this application. Stay tuned for more updates.
